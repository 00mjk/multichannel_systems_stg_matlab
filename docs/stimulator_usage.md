# Voltage Mode

From the manual for easier reference:
- Usually use + and GND outputs
- Voltage between + and - is doubled from specified voltage

#Sync Output

- time lag between sync and voltage output is approximately 15 us
- "  " current, 15 us for continuous mode
- "  " current, 50 us if not continuous mode

# Current Mode

- Usually use + and GND outputs
- Using + and - doubles compliance voltage from 60 to 120V
